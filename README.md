*The what, why, and how:* 
      
This project is to build a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. 
## Usage

* On opening the book search engine then I am presented with a menu with the options Search for Books and Login/Signup and an input field to search for books and a submit button
* On clicking the Search for Books menu option
then I am presented with an input field to search for books and a submit button
* If am not logged in and enter a search term in the input field and click the submit button then I am presented with several search results, each featuring a book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site
* On clicking the Login/Signup menu option
then a modal appears on the screen with a toggle between the option to log in or sign up
* When the toggle is set to Signup
then I am presented with three inputs for a username, an email address, and a password, and a signup button
* When the toggle is set to Login
then I am presented with two inputs for an email address and a password and login button
* On entering a valid email address and create a password and click on the signup button
then my user account is created and I am logged in to the site
* On entering my account’s email address and password and click on the login button
then I the modal closes and I am logged in to the site
* When I am logged in to the site

then I am presented with several search results, each featuring a book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site and a button to save a book to my account
* On clicking on the Save button on a book
then that book’s information is saved to my account
